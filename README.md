# Steps followed to create Api based React App

## Data Management

I've chosen redux way to distribute centralized the data to all the components

## Styling

I've used SASS for designing purposes.

## Data Fetching

I've fetched the data from the remote api using axios

## Code

I've chosen the functional component to build the app. I've created reusable components for each card and also made proper use of setTimeout() and other react hooks such as useState() and useEffect().

# Live Demo

The app can be view on Live Demo Mode at https://bit1100.github.io/API_DataFetching_ReactApp/

## Project Code

The app code is available on my github account at https://github.com/Bit1100/API_DataFetching_ReactApp
